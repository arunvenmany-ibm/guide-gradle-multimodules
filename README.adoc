= Creating a multi-module application with Gradle

[.hidden]
NOTE: This repository contains the guide documentation source. To view the guide in published form, view it on the https://openliberty.io/guides/{projectid}.html[Open Liberty website^].

You will learn how to build an application with multiple modules with Gradle and Open Liberty.

// =================================================================================================
// What you'll learn
// =================================================================================================

== What you'll learn

A Jakarta Platform, Enterprise Edition (Jakarta EE) application consists of modules that work together as one entity. An enterprise archive (EAR) is a wrapper for a Jakarta EE application, which consists of web archive (WAR) and Java archive (JAR) files. To deploy or distribute the Jakarta EE application into new environments, all the modules and resources must first be packaged into an EAR file.

In this guide, you will learn how to:

* establish a dependency between a web module and a Java library module,
* use Gradle to package the WAR file and the JAR file into an EAR file so that you can run and test the application on Open Liberty, and
* use Liberty Gradle plug-in to develop a multi-module application in https://openliberty.io/docs/latest/development-mode.html#_run_multi_module_gradle_projects_in_dev_mode[dev mode^] without having to prebuild the JAR and WAR files. In dev mode, your changes are automatically picked up by the running Liberty instance.

You will build a unit converter application that converts heights from centimeters into feet and inches. The application will request the user to enter a height value in centimeters. Then, the application processes the input by using functions that are found in the JAR file to return the height value in imperial units.


// =================================================================================================
// Getting Started
// =================================================================================================

[role=command]
include::{common-includes}/gitclone.adoc[]

Access partial implementation of the application from the `start` folder. This folder includes a web module in the `war` folder, a Java library in the `jar` folder, and template files in the `ear` folder. However, the Java library and the web module are independent projects, and you will need to complete the following steps to implement the application:

1. Add a dependency relationship between the two modules.

2. Assemble the entire application into an EAR file.

3. Aggregate the entire build.

4. Test the multi-module application.

=== Try what you'll build

The `finish` directory in the root of this guide contains the finished application. Give it a try before you proceed.

To try out the application, first go to the `finish` directory and run the following Gradle task to build the application:

[role=command]
----
cd finish
./gradlew libertyPackage
----

To deploy your EAR application on Open Liberty, run the Gradle `libertyRun` task from the finish directory.

[role=command]
----
./gradlew libertyRun
----

ifndef::cloud-hosted[]
Once the Liberty instance is running, you can find the application at the following URL: http://localhost:9080/converter/[http://localhost:9080/converter/^]
endif::[]
ifdef::cloud-hosted[]
Once the Liberty instance is running, click the following button to check out your service by visiting the ***/converter*** endpoint.
::startApplication{port="9080" display="external" name="Visit application" route="/converter"}
endif::[]

After you are finished checking out the application, stop the Open Liberty instance by pressing `CTRL+C` in the command-line session where you ran the Liberty. Alternatively, you can run the `libertyStop` task from the `finish` directory in another command-line session:

[role=command]
----
./gradlew libertyStop
----

// =================================================================================================
// Adding dependencies between WAR and JAR modules
// =================================================================================================

== Adding dependencies between WAR and JAR modules

To use a Java library in your web module, you must add a dependency relationship between the two modules.

As you might have noticed, each module has its own `build.gradle` file. Each module has its own `build.gradle` file because each module is treated as an independent project. You can rebuild, reuse, and reassemble every module on its own.

Navigate to the `start` directory to begin.
// cloud hosted instructions
ifdef::cloud-hosted[]
```bash
cd /home/project/guide-gradle-multimodules/start
```
endif::[]

[role="code_command hotspot", subs="quotes"]
----
#Replace the war/build.gradle file.#
`war/build.gradle`
----
war/build.gradle
[source, xml, linenums, role='code_column']
----
include::finish/war/build.gradle[]
----
The added [hotspot=projectJar file=0]`project` dependency and [hotspot=dependsOn file=0]`dependsOn` element declare the Java library project and module that implements the functions that you need for the unit converter.

// =================================================================================================
// Assembling multiple modules into an EAR file
// =================================================================================================

== Assembling multiple modules into an EAR file

To deploy the entire application on Open Liberty, first package the application. Use the EAR project to assemble multiple modules into an EAR file.

Navigate to the `ear` folder and find a template `build.gradle` file.
[role="code_command hotspot", subs="quotes"]
----
#Replace the ear/build.gradle file.#
`ear/build.gradle`
----
ear/build.gradle
[source, xml, linenums, role='code_column']
----
include::finish/ear/build.gradle[]
----

Define the [hotspot=ear file=0]`ear` and [hotspot=liberty file=0]`liberty` plug-ins that you want to use. Configure the [hotspot=earConfig file=0]`ear` task with the deployment descriptor that provides the web module file name and the context root as [hotspot=webModule file=0]`/converter`.

If no context path is specified, Gradle automatically uses the WAR file artifact ID as the context root for the application while generating the `application.xml` file. The default artifact ID is `{pojectName}-{moduleName}-{version}`. For this guide, it is `guide-gradle-multimodules-war-1.0-SNAPSHOT`.

Configure the [hotspot=libertyConfig file=0]`liberty` task that creates the Liberty server name as [hotspot=sampleLibertyServer file=0]`sampleLibertyServer` and deploys the ear file from the path specified by the [hotspot=copyLibsDirectory file=0]`copyLibsDirectory` variable.

The [hotspot=war file=0]`war` project is added as a project dependency. The [hotspot=deployDependsOn file=0]`deploy` task depends on the `ear` task and the [hotspot=earDependsOn file=0]`ear` task depends on the `jar` task from the `jar` project and the `war` task from the `war` project.

To deploy and run an EAR application on an Open Liberty instance, you need to provide a Liberty's `server.xml` configuration file.

[role="code_command hotspot file=1", subs="quotes"]
----
#Create the Liberty `server.xml` configuration file.#
`ear/src/main/liberty/config/server.xml`
----
server.xml
[source, xml, linenums, role='code_column']
----
include::finish/ear/src/main/liberty/config/server.xml[]
----

You must configure the `server.xml` configuration file with the [hotspot=EARdefinition file=1]`enterpriseApplication` element to specify the location of your EAR application.

// =================================================================================================
// Aggregating the entire build
// =================================================================================================

== Aggregating the entire build

Because you have multiple modules, aggregate the Gradle projects to simplify the build process.

The `settings.gradle` is used to specify multiple modules.

[role="code_command hotspot", subs="quotes"]
----
#Replace the start/settings.gradle file.#
`settings.gradle`
----
start/settings.gradle
[source, xml, linenums, role='code_column']
----
include::finish/settings.gradle[]
----

Include the [hotspot=includeJar hotspot=jarDir file=0]`jar`, [hotspot=includeWar hotspot=warDir file=0]`war`, and [hotspot=includeEar hotspot=earDir file=0]`ear` projects and their directories.

Create a parent [hotspot file=1]`build.gradle` file under the `start` directory to link all of the child modules together. A template is provided for you.

[role="code_command hotspot file=1", subs="quotes"]
----
#Replace the start/build.gradle file.#
`build.gradle`
----
start/build.gradle
[source, xml, linenums, role='code_column']
----
include::finish/build.gradle[]
----

Set the [hotspot=allprojects file=1]`basic configuration` for the project. Apply [hotspot=java file=1]`java` plugin and its [hotspot=options file=1]`options` to all sub-projects. The plugins and dependencies will be downloaded from the repositories that are specified in the [hotspot=repositories file=1]`repositories` configuration. Each child module inherits all the configurations.



// =================================================================================================
// Developing the application
// =================================================================================================

== Developing the application

You can now develop the application and the different modules together in dev mode by using the Liberty Gradle plug-in. To learn more about how to use dev mode with multiple modules, check out the https://github.com/OpenLiberty/ci.gradle/blob/main/docs/dev.md#multiple-modules[Documentation^].

Navigate to the `start` directory to begin.
// cloud hosted instructions
ifdef::cloud-hosted[]
```bash
cd /home/project/guide-gradle-multimodules/start
```
endif::[]

When you run Open Liberty in https://openliberty.io/docs/latest/development-mode.html[dev mode^], dev mode listens for file changes and automatically recompiles and deploys your updates whenever you save a new change. Run the following task to start Open Liberty in dev mode:

[role="command"]
----
./gradlew libertyDev
----

After you see the following message, your Liberty instance is ready in dev mode:

[role="no_copy"]
----
**************************************************************
*    Liberty is running in dev mode.
----

Dev mode holds your command-line session to listen for file changes. Open another command-line session to continue, or open the project in your editor.

=== Updating the Java classes in different modules

Update the `HeightsBean` class to use the Java library module that implements the functions that you need for the unit converter.

Navigate to the `start` directory.

[role="code_command hotspot file=0", subs="quotes"]
----
#Replace the `HeightsBean` class in the `war` directory.#
`war/src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/multimodules/web/HeightsBean.java`
----
HeightsBean.java
[source, Java, linenums, role='code_column hide_tags=copyright']
----
include::finish/war/src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/multimodules/web/HeightsBean.java[]
----

The [hotspot=getFeet file=0]`getFeet(cm)` invocation was added to the [hotspot=setHeightFeet file=0]`setHeightFeet` method to convert a measurement into feet.

The [hotspot=getInches file=0]`getInches(cm)` invocation was added to the [hotspot=setHeightInches file=0]`setHeightInches` method to convert a measurement into inches.

ifndef::cloud-hosted[]
You can check out the running application by going to the http://localhost:9080/converter/[http://localhost:9080/converter/^] URL.
endif::[]
ifdef::cloud-hosted[]
Click the following button to check out the running application by visiting the ***/converter*** endpoint:
::startApplication{port="9080" display="external" name="Visit application" route="/converter"}
endif::[]

Now try updating the converter so that it converts heights correctly, rather than returning 0.

[role="code_command hotspot file=1", subs="quotes"]
----
#Replace the `Converter` class in the `jar` directory.#
`jar/src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/multimodules/lib/Converter.java`
----
Converter.java
[source, Java, linenums, role='code_column hide_tags=copyright']
----
include::finish/jar/src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/multimodules/lib/Converter.java[]
----

Change the [hotspot=getFeetMethod file=1]`getFeet` method so that it converts from centimetres to feet, and the [hotspot=getInchesMethod file=1]`getInches` method so that it converts from centimetres to inches. Update the `sum`, `diff`, `product` and `quotient` functions so that they add, subtract, multiply, and divide 2 numbers respectively.

ifndef::cloud-hosted[]
Now revisit the application at the http://localhost:9080/converter/[http://localhost:9080/converter/^] URL. Try entering a height in centimetres and see if it converts correctly.
endif::[]
ifdef::cloud-hosted[]
Now revisit the application by visiting the ***/converter*** endpoint:
::startApplication{port="9080" display="external" name="Visit application" route="/converter"}

Try entering a height in centimetres and see if it converts correctly.
endif::[]


=== Testing the multi-module application

To test the multi-module application, add integration tests to the EAR project.

[role="code_command hotspot", subs="quotes"]
----
#Create the integration test class in the `ear` directory.#
`ear/src/test/java/it/io/openliberty/guides/multimodules/IT.java`
----
IT.java
[source, Java, linenums, role='code_column hide_tags=copyright']
----
include::finish/ear/src/test/java/it/io/openliberty/guides/multimodules/IT.java[]
----

The [hotspot=testIndexPage file=0]`testIndexPage` tests to check that you can access the landing page.

The [hotspot=testHeightsPage file=0]`testHeightsPage` tests to check that the application can process the input value and calculate the result correctly.


=== Running the tests

Because you started Open Liberty in dev mode, press the *enter/return* key to run the tests.

You will see the following output:

[source, role="no_copy"]

== Building the multi-module application

You aggregated and developed the application. Now, you can run `./gradlew clean libertyPackage` once from the `start` directory and it will automatically build all your modules. This command creates a JAR file in the `jar/build` directory, a WAR file in the `war/build` directory, and an EAR file that contains the JAR and WAR files in the `ear/build` directory.

ifndef::cloud-hosted[]
Run the following command from the start directory to build the entire application:

[role=command]
----
./gradlew clean libertyPackage
----
endif::[]
ifdef::cloud-hosted[]
Run the following commands to navigate to the start directory and build the entire application:
```bash
cd /home/project/guide-gradle-multimodules/start
./gradlew clean libertyPackage
```
endif::[]

Because the modules are independent, you can re-build them individually by running `./gradlew clean build` from the corresponding `start` directory for each module.

ifndef::cloud-hosted[]
Or, run `./gradlew <child project>:build` from the start directory.
endif::[]
ifdef::cloud-hosted[]
Or, run `./gradlew <child project>:build` from the start directory.
endif::[]

// =================================================================================================
// Congratulations! You're done!
// =================================================================================================

== Great work! You're done!

You built and tested a multi-module Java application for unit conversion with Gradle on Open Liberty.
